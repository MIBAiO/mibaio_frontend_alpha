                                        Our store collects data to operate
                                        effectively and provide you the best
                                        experiences with our services. You
                                        provide some of this data directly, such
                                        as when you create a personal account.
                                        We get some of it by recording how you
                                        interact with our services by, for
                                        example, using technologies like

                                        parties (including other companies). For
                                        example, we supplement the data we
                                        collect by purchasing demographic data
                                        from other companies. We also use
                                        services from other companies to help us
                                        determine a location based on your IP

                                        Our web site uses the data we collect
